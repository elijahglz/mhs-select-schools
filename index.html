                    <p>
                        Have you ever thought of working in the medical field? Do you want a career in healthcare helping 
                        people fight illness and return to function from injury? Are you interested in working hard in a 
                        prestigious and rigorous program that gives you opportunities to learn actual medical skills with 
                        actual patients? If the answer is yes to all of these questions, then applying to the Mojave Medical 
                        Academy is a step you should take. The Mojave Medical Academy was established in 2013 and is now 
                        offering students the opportunity to take medical classes that were previously only available to medical 
                        magnet schools.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Mojave Medical Academy has a 3 year program sequence that you can start as a freshman or sophomore. 
                        Our program currently has two branches of study that you will focus on during your second and 3rd year. 
                        You can either choose a pathway in Physical Therapy/Sports Medicine or Medical Assisting. You will leave 
                        our academy with an advanced knowledge of the healthcare field and actual patient care experience that 
                        you can learn in our very own physical therapy/rehabilitation clinic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a member of the Mojave Medical Academy, you will have a scrub uniform and take numerous field trips 
                        during your time here. You will have the opportunity for observations, volunteer experiences and even 
                        possible internships in our local medical community. You will be able to compete in national healthcare
                        competitions against other students in the united states in health science programs and have chances to 
                        win awards and scholarships.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The benefits of the Mojave Medical Academy do not stop at graduation from high school, as now you will 
                        have advanced preparation and training to work in the medical field directly after high school or excel 
                        in college as you work towards professional careers in the medical field. You will confidently take 
                        difficult classes on your way to becoming a physician, nurse, physical therapist, optometrist, pharmacist, 
                        lab scientist, nuclear medicine specialist, and many other careers because of your advanced training by 
                        the experienced faculty that direct the Mojave Medical Academy.
